## 1. To run the Q1 in python, open the terminal and change ***value*** to whatever Nth Digit Number Length you want.
	
#### python (Question 1)N_digitsLength.py value
	

## 2. This way imports StringUtils and compare the user given input vs length stored in the contract. 
- After deploying there are two buttons, 
	- **setProof** which takes string value as a proof 
	- **getInfo** which before proof says "No transaction" and after proof gives 0.1 ETH to whosoever solves the Q1 for 100th digits first
	

## 3. This way uses hashed value prefed for the answer, then hash the user given input, and compares it with hashed value stores in contract. 
- After deploying there are two buttons, 
	- **setProof** which takes string value as a proof 
	- **getInfo** which before proof says "No transaction" and after proof gives 0.1 ETH to whosoever solves the Q1 for 100th digits first
